# Docker Setup
The following instructions are provided for Linux users. Make sure that you have a reasonably recent version.If you are  [Mac](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/) or a  [Windows](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/#download-docker-for-windows) user, follow the instructions from the respective link provided. It should be straightforward.

1. Update apt package:
    ```
    $ sudo apt-get update
    ```
2. Install packages to allow apt to use a   repository over HTTPS:

  ```
  $ sudo apt-get install \
     apt-transport-https \
     ca-certificates \
     curl \
     gnupg2 \
     software-properties-common
     ```
3. Add Docker’s official GPG key:

  ```
  $ curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/$(. /etc/os-release; echo "$ID")/gpg | sudo apt-key add -
  ```
  Verify that you now have the key with the fingerprint 9DC8 5822 9FC7 DD38 854A E2D8 8D81 803C 0EBF CD88, by searching for the last 8 characters of the fingerprint.

  ```
  $ sudo apt-key fingerprint 0EBFCD88

  ```
4. Setup stable repository:

  ```
  $ sudo add-apt-repository \
   "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/$(. /etc/os-release; echo "$ID") \
   $(lsb_release -cs) \
   stable"
   ```

5. Install DOCKER CE:
  ```
  $ sudo apt-get install docker-ce
  ```
6. Verify that Docker CE is installed correctly by running the hello-world image.
```
$ sudo docker run hello-world
```
This command downloads a test image and runs it in a container. When the container runs, it prints an informational message and exits.
